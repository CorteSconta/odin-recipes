        <p>The orgin of the spritz date back to the Hbsburg domination of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. The soldiers and the people of the Habsburg Empire in Veneto became accustomed to drinking local wine but, the alcohol content was too high for them. They started to ask the local hosts to spray (spritzen, in German) some water into the wine to make it lighter for their barbaric taste.</p>
        <p>Between 1920s and 1930s, in Venice or in Padua, Spritz was combined with local bitters (usually drunk with soda and ice): after all, Aperol was born in Padua in 1919 and Select in Venice in 1920.
          The original recipe has supposedly remained unchanged over time but it wasn't until the 1970s that the modern Spritz recipe was set, with prosecco instead of still wine</p>
